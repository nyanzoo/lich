BUGS:
- Sometimes on good deployments the traffic gets stuck, seems to be from sending from incoming? See logs for more info.
- We get crash on sends for channels because the receiver drops and that seems to be caused due to connection failure.
  So, we need to make that more robust.
- Sometimes after a deployment the services don't connect to form a chain with `error failed to lookup address information: Name or service not known`
