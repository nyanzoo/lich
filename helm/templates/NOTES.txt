BUGS:
- Sometimes on good deployments the traffic gets stuck, seems to be from sending from incoming? See logs for more info.
- We get crash on sends for channels because the receiver drops and that seems to be caused due to connection failure.
  So, we need to make that more robust.
- Sometimes after a deployment the services don't connect to form a chain with `error failed to lookup address information: Name or service not known`
- Adding buffer pools seems to lead to things getting stuck when we run out of buffer, so we need to fix that.
- currently breaking due to session in ack getting dropped which breaks everything else. Losing the session is possible, so we need to do two things:
    - Find out why session was lost
    - Make sure that we can recover from session loss


- UPDATE: backend not coming up in time now after bufwriter change?
- UPDATE: still getting live-locked?
